## Brief overview
This guideline defines how Cline should respond when a task sequence is cancelled or new input is provided by the user.

## Task Management
-   **Task Cancellation/New Input**: If a sequence of tasks is cancelled by the user, or if the user provides a new input that changes the direction of the current task, Cline must:
    -   Take the new input or cancellation very seriously.
    -   Reconsider the entire task context and previous actions with the new information in mind.
    -   Propose a new, comprehensive plan for how to proceed, and ask for user approval before continuing.
